# OplNotes
The OPL notes I wrote in the late 90s and early 00s for the Nokia Communicators 9200, 9300 and 9500 series and Psion 5, 6 and 7 series. OPL is obviously a dead language now, but the routines can be quite useful as reference.

OPL's main strength was the ease with which it could #include C++ libraries for PDA and mobile phone features such as camera, Bluetooth, IrDA, SMS, clipboard, touch-screen and much more.

dpNotes are a collection of - hopefully - useful ideas for the furtherance of OPL programming. In dpNotes we focus primarily on Symbian OS v6 (ER6) and later, though some of it was around already at v5 (ER5). A big difference between v1-v5 and v6-v7 and later is that the former was based on ASCII whereas the latter was on Unicode.

Clarification of OPL versions:

ER5 - Symbian v5, extended Ascii, Psion Series 5, Series 5mx, Series 7, netPad and netBook
ER5u - Symbian v5.1, Unicode, Ericsson R380
ER6 - Symbian v6, Nokia 92xx Communicators, Unicode
ER7 - Symbian v7, Nokia 9300, 9500 Communicators, Series 80, Series 90, UIQ and Series 60, Unicode
