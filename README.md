# OplNotes
The OPL notes I wrote in the late 90s and early 00s for the Nokia Communicators 9200, 9300 and 9500 series and Psion 5, 6 and 7 series. OPL is obviously a dead language now, but the routines can be quite useful as reference.

OPL's main strength was the ease with which it could #include C++ libraries for PDA and mobile phone features such as camera, Bluetooth, IrDA, SMS, clipboard, touch-screen and much more.
